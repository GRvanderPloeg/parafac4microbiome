Description: Creation and selection of PARAllel FACtor Analysis (PARAFAC) models of longitudinal microbiome data.
    You can import your own data with our import functions or use one of the example datasets to create your own
    PARAFAC models. Selection of the number of components is fully handled using assessModelQuality and
    assessModelStability giving you various metrics to select the optimal model. The selected model can then be
    plotted using plotPARAFACmodel which offers a 'ggplot2'-based overview of the loadings. The Parallel Factor
    Analysis method was originally described by Caroll & Chang (1970)
    <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02310791> and Harshman (1970)
    <https://www.psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/harshman/wpppfac0.pdf>.
