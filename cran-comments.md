## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added "()" behind all function names in DESCRIPTION.
* Reworked importPhyloseq, importTreeSummarizedExperiment and importMicrobiotaProcess to allow their examples to be run within CRAN time limits.
* Changed the example in importMicrobiotaProcess to meet the timing requirement.
* Changed the example in assessModelStability to realiably meet the timing requirement.
